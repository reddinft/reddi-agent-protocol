# @reddi/openrouter-specialists

Shared runtime for Reddi Agent Protocol marketplace specialists backed by OpenRouter.

Iteration 3 includes the default attestor path: `verification-validation-agent` is both a `specialist` and `attestor`, can evaluate specialist outputs plus receipt chains, and returns a structured `reddi.attestation.v1` deterministic local settlement recommendation.

Iteration 4 starts agent-to-agent composability in dry-run mode: consumer-capable specialists can return a deterministic marketplace delegation plan without performing downstream x402 negotiation or spending devnet SOL.

Iteration 4.5 hardens dry-run discovery with a manifest-backed discovery adapter and a no-spend deployment readiness report. It still does not deploy, fund wallets, inspect secrets, sign transactions, or execute live downstream x402 calls.

Iteration 5b adds signer-safe wallet provenance, devnet-only funding helpers, and idempotent devnet registration helpers for the first five specialists. These tools load signer keypairs from environment variables only, derive public keys, and write public-only artifacts. They fail closed when signer env is absent and reject non-devnet RPC endpoints.

## Safety defaults

- No private keys are stored here.
- Wallet values are public devnet addresses only; Iteration 2 replaces static profile values with a public wallet manifest and balance verifier.
- Iteration 5b signer tooling loads keypairs from env only and writes public keys, env var names, balances, PDAs, and transaction signatures only — never secret key bytes.
- Funding and registration scripts are devnet-only and fail before sending transactions if pointed at a non-devnet RPC endpoint.
- `OPENROUTER_MOCK` must be explicitly set to `1` or `true` to use mock mode.
- If mock mode is disabled, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is required before an OpenRouter client can be created.
- Demo payment headers are accepted only when `ALLOW_DEMO_X402_PAYMENT=1` or `true`.
- `ENABLE_AGENT_TO_AGENT_CALLS` defaults to disabled. Iteration 4 supports dry-run delegation plans only; live delegation requests fail closed with `live_delegation_not_implemented` until a later guarded live-call iteration.
- Caller-controlled strings such as `paid:` or JSON containing `signature` are not treated as payment proof.
- Until real x402 settlement verification is wired, production deployments should leave `ALLOW_DEMO_X402_PAYMENT` unset and fail closed on unpaid requests.
- Attestation verdicts are settlement recommendations only: `release` pays the specialist, `refund` returns funds to requester, and `dispute` holds for human/secondary review.

## Attestation mode

Use the attestor profile (`SPECIALIST_PROFILE_ID=verification-validation-agent`) with either route shape:

- `POST /v1/attestations`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` with `metadata.mode="attestation"` and `metadata.attestation`

Minimal request body:

```json
{
  "mode": "attestation",
  "subjectProfileId": "planning-agent",
  "specialistOutput": "Specialist output to review...",
  "receiptChain": [
    { "id": "receipt-1", "type": "x402-payment", "status": "satisfied", "amount": "0.03", "currency": "USDC" }
  ],
  "domain": "general operations"
}
```

Response body includes `verdictSource="deterministic_local_evaluator"`, `verdict.schemaVersion`, `score`, `checks`, `summary`, `recommendedAction`, regulated-domain caveats when relevant, and explicit release/refund/dispute semantics. The runtime still sends an attestation prompt envelope through the configured OpenRouter/mock client for auditability and future LLM attestor parsing, but the returned settlement recommendation is currently produced by the deterministic local evaluator. A future live-LLM attestor must parse and validate upstream `reddi.attestation.v1` output and fail closed/dispute on malformed output.

## Dry-run marketplace delegation mode

Use a consumer-capable profile such as `planning-agent` with `POST /v1/chat/completions`, a satisfied x402 payment, and `metadata.mode="delegation_plan"`.

Minimal request body:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "Plan a launch that needs document evidence extraction and code implementation." }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "mode": "delegation_plan",
    "delegation": {
      "requiredCapabilities": ["document-analysis", "code-generation"],
      "maxCandidates": 3
    }
  }
}
```

Response body includes `object="reddi.delegation.plan"`, deterministic candidate ranking by capability match, price, reputation, and freshness, estimated cost, required attestor, and guardrails. `downstreamCallsExecuted` is always `0` in this iteration. No signer/private-key material is used and no downstream paid call is attempted.

The dry-run planner can use the public wallet manifest as a discovery source. Malformed manifest candidates are excluded with explicit reasons in `discoveryDiagnostics`; they are not silently ranked.

## Iteration 5b wallet provenance, funding, and registration

### Signer env format

Signer material must come from environment variables. Do not write these values to files or commit them.

Bulk env, keyed by profile ID:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_SPECIALIST_SIGNER_KEYPAIRS_JSON='{
  "planning-agent": [64, byte, secret, key, ...],
  "document-intelligence-agent": {"secretKey": [64, byte, secret, key, ...]}
}'
```

Or per-profile env vars:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_SPECIALIST_PLANNING_AGENT_SIGNER_KEYPAIR_JSON='[64, byte, secret, key, ...]'
export OPENROUTER_SPECIALIST_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_AGENT_SIGNER_KEYPAIR_JSON='{"secretKey":[64, byte, secret, key, ...]}'
export OPENROUTER_SPECIALIST_VERIFICATION_VALIDATION_AGENT_SIGNER_KEYPAIR_JSON='[64, byte, secret, key, ...]'
export OPENROUTER_SPECIALIST_CODE_GENERATION_AGENT_SIGNER_KEYPAIR_JSON='[64, byte, secret, key, ...]'
export OPENROUTER_SPECIALIST_CONVERSATIONAL_AGENT_SIGNER_KEYPAIR_JSON='[64, byte, secret, key, ...]'
```

Supported JSON material shapes are a 64-byte secret-key array, `{ "secretKey": [...] }`, `{ "privateKey": [...] }`, or `{ "keypair": [...] }`. The scripts derive public keys from the signer and never persist the secret-key array.

### Render and verify a signer-backed public manifest

```bash
npm run wallet:render-signer-manifest
npm run wallet:verify-signer-provenance -- artifacts/signer-wallet-manifest.json
```

The rendered manifest contains `profileId`, `displayName`, derived `publicKey`, and `signerProvenance.sourceEnv` only. It is safe to publish after review. The existing static `public/wallet-manifest.json` remains public-only; use `--require-signer-provenance` when gating a signer-backed replacement.

### Request devnet airdrops

```bash
WALLET_MANIFEST_PATH=artifacts/signer-wallet-manifest.json \
AIRDROP_ARTIFACT_OUT=artifacts/devnet-airdrop-report.json \
npm run wallet:airdrop-devnet
```

Defaults: `SOLANA_DEVNET_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com`, `AIRDROP_MAX_ATTEMPTS=3`, exponential backoff, and a public-only artifact containing profile IDs, public keys, balances, requested lamports, and tx signatures. Faucet rate limits are expected; failures are recorded without leaking signer material.

### Register the first five specialists on devnet

```bash
REGISTRATION_ARTIFACT_OUT=artifacts/devnet-registration-report.json \
npm run wallet:register-devnet
```

Registration requires signer env for all first-five profiles. It checks the agent PDA before sending, skips already-registered specialists, refuses to register underfunded signers, and writes a public-only artifact with owner public keys, PDAs, balances, status, and tx signatures. Program ID defaults to the devnet escrow program and can be overridden with `OPENROUTER_SPECIALIST_ESCROW_PROGRAM_ID` or `DEMO_ESCROW_PROGRAM_ID`.

Guardrails: devnet only, no mainnet RPC, no committed private keys, no OpenRouter/live downstream calls.

## Deployment readiness preflight

Generate a public-data-only readiness report:

```bash
npm run deployment:readiness
```

Optional environment inputs:

- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` — planned specialist endpoint base URL.
- `FUNDED_PROFILE_IDS` — comma-separated profile IDs already funded/approved.
- `DEPLOYED_PROFILE_IDS` — comma-separated profile IDs already deployed/approved.
- `READINESS_OUT` — output path, default `artifacts/deployment-readiness.json`.

The report is expected to be `blocked` before approval/funding/deployment. It reports missing endpoints, funding, and Coolify deployment as blockers while preserving guardrails: public metadata only, no private keys/signers, no devnet SOL spend, no deployment, and no live downstream x402 calls.

## Validation

```bash
npm test
```

From repo root:

```bash
docker build -f packages/openrouter-specialists/Dockerfile -t reddi-openrouter-specialists:iter1 .
```
