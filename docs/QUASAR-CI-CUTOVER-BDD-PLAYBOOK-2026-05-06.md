# Quasar CI Cutover BDD Playbook — 2026-05-06

## Goal

Replace final-demo integrity checks that currently depend on legacy Anchor `programs/escrow` with required CI that compiles and tests the Quasar-based Solana programs used by the final Colosseum demo.

The target state is **not** “no LiteSVM.” LiteSVM/QuasarSVM-style local execution remains useful. The target state is **no Anchor program tests masquerading as final Quasar proof**.

## Non-negotiable success criteria

1. Final required CI includes Quasar program compile/test coverage for escrow, registry, reputation, and attestation.
2. `quasar-readiness-guard.yml` remains required for app/demo/runtime wiring, so code cannot drift back to Anchor IDs/layouts.
3. Legacy Anchor CI is removed from final-required checks; Quasar CI is the final program proof gate.
4. Every phase ends with a retrospective and a refined next-step plan before proceeding.
5. No deployment, env/Coolify/Vercel mutation, paid/live specialist work, or live PER/TEE claim is introduced by this CI cutover.

## Current inventory — Phase 0 baseline

### Existing repo CI

- `.github/workflows/anchor-test.yml`
  - Current name: `Anchor Tests`
  - Job: `Build & Test (Anchor 1.0.0 / LiteSVM)`
  - Builds `programs/escrow` via `anchor build --ignore-keys`
  - Runs `cargo test --manifest-path programs/escrow/Cargo.toml`
  - This is legacy/reference coverage only.
- `.github/workflows/quasar-readiness-guard.yml`
  - Runs `npm run check:quasar:submission`
  - Validates runtime/config/readiness guardrails.
  - Does **not** compile or test Quasar program source.

### Quasar source locations discovered locally

- Registry: `/Users/loki/projects/reddi-agent-protocol/experiments/quasar-registry`
- Reputation: `/Users/loki/projects/reddi-agent-protocol/experiments/quasar-reputation`
- Attestation: `/Users/loki/projects/reddi-agent-protocol/experiments/quasar-attestation`
- Escrow POC used by final demo layout: `/Users/loki/.openclaw/workspace/projects/rrap-poc/experiments/quasar-escrow`
- Quasar framework dependency source: `/Users/loki/.openclaw/workspace/projects/colosseum-frontier/research/quasar/quasar-repo` at `0e7559496b86aebe300254d90baa7210672c1cbf`, remote `https://github.com/blueshift-gg/quasar`

### Immediate implication

The app repo currently does not contain the Quasar program source directories. A real Quasar program CI must first vendor/import those sources, then make their `quasar-lang` dependency CI-resolvable without relying on Nissan’s local absolute path.

## Phase plan

### Phase 0 — CI truth inventory and acceptance criteria

**BDD scenario**

Given PR #244 is the final Quasar cutover PR
When CI is evaluated for final readiness
Then we can distinguish legacy Anchor reference checks from Quasar final-proof checks
And the next phase has explicit inputs, blockers, and acceptance criteria.

**Actions**

- Inventory current workflows and local Quasar source locations.
- Document required target state and non-goals.
- Record whether the repo already contains Quasar program source.

**Validation**

- `find ... Cargo.toml` confirms Quasar sources exist locally but not in the app repo.
- Existing workflows inspected: `anchor-test.yml` and `quasar-readiness-guard.yml`.

**Retrospective checkpoint**

- If sources are missing from the app repo, do not edit required CI yet. First create/import stable source layout.
- If CI dependency paths are absolute/local-only, phase 1 must make them portable before adding a required workflow.

**Phase 0 retrospective — completed 2026-05-06**

- Expected: find an existing Quasar program test workflow or program source in repo.
- Actual: only runtime readiness guard exists in repo; Quasar program sources are split across local worktrees and use absolute `quasar-lang` paths.
- Adjustment: Phase 1 must be a source/dependency normalization phase, not a workflow-only phase.

### Phase 1 — Vendor/import Quasar program sources into this repo

**BDD scenario**

Given the final demo uses four Quasar programs
When a developer checks out the repo on CI
Then the escrow, registry, reputation, and attestation Quasar sources are present under a stable repo path
And no test depends on `/Users/loki/...` absolute paths.

**Proposed repo layout**

```text
experiments/quasar-escrow/
experiments/quasar-registry/
experiments/quasar-reputation/
experiments/quasar-attestation/
third_party/quasar/   # or a pinned git checkout/submodule strategy, decided in phase 1
```

**Actions**

- Copy/import the four Quasar program directories into `experiments/`.
- Decide dependency strategy:
  - preferred for hackathon stability: vendor/pin `third_party/quasar` from `blueshift-gg/quasar@0e7559496b86aebe300254d90baa7210672c1cbf`;
  - alternative: GitHub Actions checkout of `blueshift-gg/quasar` to a known path and patch Cargo paths during CI.
- Replace absolute `quasar-lang` paths with repo-relative paths.
- Run local compile/test for one program first, then all four.

**Validation target**

- `cargo test --manifest-path experiments/quasar-registry/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo test --manifest-path experiments/quasar-reputation/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo test --manifest-path experiments/quasar-attestation/Cargo.toml`
- escrow equivalent once imported.

**Retrospective checkpoint**

- If compile fails due to toolchain or Quasar SBF setup, split pure Rust/QuasarSVM tests from SBF builds.
- If vendoring Quasar is too large for this PR, use pinned CI checkout and document the exact commit.

### Phase 2 — Add Quasar program test workflow in non-destructive mode

**BDD scenario**

Given Quasar program sources are in the repo
When a PR touches `experiments/quasar-*`, Quasar config, or demo wiring
Then GitHub Actions runs Quasar program tests independently of Anchor CI.

**Actions**

- Add `.github/workflows/quasar-program-tests.yml`.
- Name required job clearly, e.g. `Quasar Program Tests (QuasarSVM/LiteSVM)`.
- Trigger on PRs touching:
  - `experiments/quasar-*/**`
  - `config/quasar/**`
  - `packages/demo-agents/**`
  - `lib/quasar/**`
- Keep `quasar-readiness-guard.yml` as a separate app/runtime guard.

**Validation target**

- Local equivalent script passes.
- PR check appears and passes at least once.

**Retrospective checkpoint**

- If runtime is too slow, cache cargo and split jobs by program.
- If one program is flaky, keep workflow required but quarantine only the flaky test with a documented issue and deadline.

### Phase 3 — Remove legacy Anchor CI from final proof

**BDD scenario**

Given Quasar program tests are green in CI
When PR #244 is assessed for final readiness
Then the blocking final-proof checks are Quasar program tests + Quasar readiness guard, not Anchor tests.

**Actions**

- Rename `anchor-test.yml` to clarify historical scope, e.g. `Legacy Anchor Reference Tests`.
- Remove `.github/workflows/anchor-test.yml` once Quasar gates are green and branch protection is not pinned to the old Anchor check name.
- Decide whether to remove it from PR triggers or keep it on `workflow_dispatch` / main-only.
- Coordinate branch protection if required checks are pinned by name.

**Validation target**

- PR checks show Quasar checks as the final-proof path.
- No docs/operator surfaces describe Anchor CI as final demo proof.

**Retrospective checkpoint**

- If branch protection requires the old check name, do not rename until Nissan updates required-check settings.
- If legacy Anchor still protects useful regression behavior, keep it but mark non-final in docs and status.

### Phase 4 — Add anti-regression assertions that connect CI to final demo IDs

**BDD scenario**

Given Quasar program tests pass
When demo/runtime config changes
Then CI proves the app still points at the same Quasar program family and cannot silently route back to Anchor.

**Actions**

- Extend readiness scripts to verify Quasar program source/test inventory exists.
- Add a check that `submissionReady=true` requires `quasar-program-tests` evidence in docs/config.
- Keep MagicBlock PER/TEE boundary explicit: either live-validated on Quasar or not a final claim.

**Validation target**

- `npm run check:quasar:submission` fails if Quasar program test evidence is removed.
- `npm run build` remains green.

**Retrospective checkpoint**

- If source/test evidence coupling is too brittle, store a small manifest with program dirs, test commands, and last successful CI run URL.

### Phase 5 — Observe one full PR loop and update final docs

**BDD scenario**

Given Quasar program tests and readiness checks are both green on PR #244
When final docs/judge packet are reviewed
Then the proof chain is Quasar-native end-to-end and legacy Anchor is historical only.

**Actions**

- Wait for all GitHub checks.
- Update judge/operator docs with exact CI names and pass status.
- Update `STATUS.md` and daily memory.

**Retrospective checkpoint**

- Record what failed, what was slow, and whether any check should become required/optional.
- If all green, PR #244 can proceed under normal merge policy.

## Begin-next recommendation

Start Phase 1 next: import the four Quasar program directories into `experiments/`, normalize the `quasar-lang` dependency path, and run one local program test before adding/changing required GitHub workflows.


## Implementation log — 2026-05-06

### Phase 1 retrospective — completed

**What we expected:** importing the four Quasar program directories and normalizing `quasar-lang` paths would be enough to run local compile/tests.

**What happened:** the local source directories were huge only because they contained generated `target/` outputs. After excluding/removing build outputs, the actual source import is small and portable. The four programs now live in repo-local `experiments/quasar-*`, and the required Quasar framework crates are vendored under `third_party/quasar` from `blueshift-gg/quasar@0e7559496b86aebe300254d90baa7210672c1cbf`.

**Refinement:** Phase 2 can proceed immediately with a first-class workflow. We do not need to rename/de-scope Anchor CI yet; that remains Phase 3 after Quasar CI proves green on GitHub.

### Phase 2 retrospective — completed locally, pending GitHub PR run

**What we expected:** add a dedicated Quasar program workflow that compiles SBF and runs QuasarSVM/LiteSVM-style tests for all four programs.

**What happened:** `.github/workflows/quasar-program-tests.yml` and `scripts/run-quasar-program-tests.sh` were added. The local compile/test loop passed for:

- `experiments/quasar-escrow` — 7 tests passed
- `experiments/quasar-registry` — 10 tests passed
- `experiments/quasar-reputation` — 11 tests passed
- `experiments/quasar-attestation` — 13 tests passed

**Validation command:**

```bash
PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH" bash scripts/run-quasar-program-tests.sh
```

**Phase 3 update:** PR #244 has first-class Quasar gates. Branch protection required-status lookup returned 404/no accessible required-status configuration, so the legacy Anchor workflow was removed after Nissan confirmed Quasar-only final demo scope.


### Phase 2 CI-retro addendum — GitHub parity fix

**Observation:** the first GitHub run for `Quasar Program Tests (QuasarSVM / LiteSVM)` failed while local validation passed. Root cause was vendoring only the Quasar crates needed by our programs while leaving upstream workspace members (`idl`, `profile`, examples, test suites, CLI) in `third_party/quasar/Cargo.toml`. CI parsed the vendored workspace directly and failed on missing members.

**Fix:** normalize `third_party/quasar/Cargo.toml` to the vendored crate set only: `lang`, `derive`, `pod`, and `spl`.

**Re-validation:**

```bash
PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH" cargo metadata --manifest-path third_party/quasar/lang/Cargo.toml --no-deps --format-version 1
PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH" bash scripts/run-quasar-program-tests.sh
```

Both pass locally after the fix. Phase 3 remains gated on the rerun/new PR check passing in GitHub.


### Phase 2 CI-retro addendum 2 — Solana cargo compatibility

**Observation:** after narrowing the vendored workspace members, GitHub still failed in `cargo build-sbf` with Cargo `1.79.0` reporting `feature edition2024 is required`. The Rust 1.89 setup was not enough because Solana/Anza `cargo build-sbf` invokes its own older cargo toolchain.

**Fix:** downgrade the vendored Quasar workspace resolver from upstream `resolver = "3"` to `resolver = "2"`, preserving package `edition = "2021"` while making the workspace parseable by the Solana SBF cargo toolchain used in CI.

**Re-validation:** local `cargo metadata` and the full `scripts/run-quasar-program-tests.sh` loop pass after the resolver fix.


### Phase 2 CI-retro addendum 3 — SBF transitive lock compatibility

**Observation:** after resolver compatibility was fixed, GitHub advanced further but `cargo build-sbf` still failed under Solana Cargo `1.79.0` when the experiment lockfiles selected `proc-macro-crate 3.5.0`, which pulls `toml_edit 0.25.x` / `toml_datetime 1.1.x` requiring edition 2024.

**Fix:** pin the experiment lockfiles to `proc-macro-crate 3.3.0`, which keeps the same downstream `num_enum`-compatible range but resolves to `toml_edit 0.22.27` / `toml_datetime 0.6.11`, parseable by Cargo 1.79. This is a lockfile compatibility fix for the Solana SBF builder, not a Quasar program semantics change.

**Re-validation:** the full local `scripts/run-quasar-program-tests.sh` loop passes after updating all four experiment `Cargo.lock` files.


### Phase 2 CI-retro addendum 4 — align SBF toolchain with local/runtime stack

**Observation:** after transitive lockfile pinning, GitHub advanced again but failed on another edition-2024 crate (`wincode-derive 0.4.4`). The deeper issue is toolchain drift: local validation uses `cargo-build-sbf 4.0.0`, `platform-tools v1.53`, `rustc 1.89.0`, and `solana-cli 3.1.13`, while the initial workflow installed Anza/Solana `v2.2.0`, whose SBF cargo path reports Cargo `1.79.0`.

**Fix:** update `.github/workflows/quasar-program-tests.yml` to install `https://release.anza.xyz/v3.1.13/install`, matching the local Quasar compile environment rather than fighting an older SBF Cargo resolver crate-by-crate.

**Plan refinement:** future Quasar CI phases must assert/print `cargo build-sbf --version` before running the compile loop, so toolchain drift is visible immediately.

### Phase 3 completion note — 2026-05-06

`.github/workflows/anchor-test.yml` was removed. Final program proof now rests on `Quasar Program Tests (QuasarSVM / LiteSVM)` and `quasar-readiness`; Anchor remains legacy/reference source only.
