# Quasar for Solana — Prize + Integration Assessment (Colosseum Frontier)

_Last updated: 2026-04-11 AEST_

## Executive summary
Short answer: **Quasar is likely not a direct "extra prize" unlock in Frontier** based on current official Frontier framing.

- Frontier explicitly removed tracks and bounties in favor of a single product-impact competition.
- Quasar appears in Colosseum Codex as a recommended technical framework/tool, not as a sponsor prize track.
- Quasar could still improve our technical narrative (performance/CU efficiency), but a full migration now is high risk this late in submission cycle.

## What Quasar is (relevant to us)
Quasar is a no_std Solana program framework (Blueshift) focused on zero-copy / low-allocation patterns for near hand-written CU efficiency.

Potential upside for our project:
- Better compute profile story (if measured and proven)
- Strong engineering depth signal to judges
- Cleaner future optimization path if agent payment volume grows

## Prize eligibility assessment
## Frontier official structure (high confidence)
From Colosseum announcement/codex posts:
- No tracks/bounties for Frontier
- Main prizes + accelerator pathway
- Sponsor list does not include Quasar/Blueshift as a dedicated prize sponsor

Conclusion: **Integrating Quasar does not currently appear to create a separate Frontier prize bucket by itself.**

## Could Quasar still help us win?
Yes, indirectly, if we use it to show:
- measurable efficiency gains,
- stronger production readiness,
- sharper technical moat narrative.

But that only helps if we can demonstrate it quickly and safely.

## Integration effort assessment for Colosseum Frontier
Given current state (protocol completed on Anchor 1.0.0 + tests + submission in polish phase), a full migration would be substantial.

## Estimated effort (rough)
### Option A: Full protocol migration to Quasar (not recommended now)
- Scope: escrow + registry + reputation + attestations (+ PER touchpoints as needed)
- Effort: **5-10 focused engineering days** + regression risk
- Risk: high (framework beta, API churn, re-testing burden)
- Submission risk: very high (could delay/demo-break)

### Option B: Targeted "hot path" pilot migration (recommended if pursued)
- Scope: migrate only escrow core instructions in a parallel branch/POC
- Effort: **1-2 days** for proof-of-concept + CU benchmark
- Risk: medium
- Submission risk: low if kept isolated from main demo path

### Option C: No migration now, mention Quasar-ready roadmap (recommended baseline)
- Scope: keep Anchor build for submission; add post-hack optimization roadmap
- Effort: **2-4 hours** documentation + benchmark plan
- Risk: low
- Submission risk: minimal

## Decision framework
Choose B/C unless one of these is true:
1. We have confirmed external bounty/prize requiring Quasar usage.
2. We can complete migration + full regression + demo hardening without impacting submission deadline.

## Recommended plan (best risk/reward)
1. **Do not full-migrate before submission.**
2. Create a small Quasar POC branch for escrow instruction path only.
3. Produce one measurable artifact: CU/size comparison table (Anchor vs Quasar POC).
4. Use this in submission as "performance roadmap already validated".

## Suggested messaging in submission/demo
"We prioritized shipping a complete trustless protocol and customer value first. We are validating Quasar on critical instruction paths to reduce compute and improve throughput for production scale."

## Open questions to resolve quickly
- Is there any non-Colosseum side prize/bounty (Superteam/sponsor) that explicitly requires Quasar?
- If yes: what exact acceptance criteria and submission format?
- If no: keep Quasar as optimization narrative, not critical path.

## Sources checked
- Colosseum Frontier announcement (tracks/bounties removed)
- Colosseum Codex post featuring Quasar as framework/tool
- Blueshift Quasar repo/docs (beta status, framework capabilities)
