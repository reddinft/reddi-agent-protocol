# BDD Scenario ID Map (A-H)

_Last updated: 2026-04-19 AEST_

Purpose: single source-of-truth mapping from BDD scenario ID -> implementation evidence -> test evidence -> lane.

Lanes:
- `route-unit` = Jest route/unit contracts (`lib/__tests__/*`)
- `e2e-ui` = Playwright UI flow (`e2e/*.spec.ts`)
- `integration` = infra-backed Playwright integration lane (`e2e/integration.spec.ts`)
- `manual` = currently documented/manual verification only

---

## Current Gaps (from map)
1. Integration lane is telemetry-backed (including probe-vs-selected model mismatch), but infra availability remains environment-dependent (expected for runtime-backed lane).
2. Scenario map promotion to executable Gherkin now spans all active buckets (`docs/bdd/features/bucket-a-onboarding.feature`, `docs/bdd/features/bucket-b-discovery.feature`, `docs/bdd/features/bucket-c-planner-consumption.feature`, `docs/bdd/features/bucket-d-e-reliability.feature`, `docs/bdd/features/bucket-f-jupiter-settlement.feature`, `docs/bdd/features/bucket-g-torque-retention.feature`, `docs/bdd/features/bucket-h-consumer-orchestrator.feature`).
3. Operational verification index is now available at `docs/bdd/FEATURE-INDEX.md`.
4. Index drift guard command is available: `npm run test:bdd:index`.
5. PR-time CI enforcement for drift guard is wired: `.github/workflows/bdd-index-guard.yml`.
6. One-command representative bucket confidence sweep is available: `npm run test:bdd:sweep`.
