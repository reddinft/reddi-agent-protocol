# Colosseum Final Quasar Proof Map — 2026-05-06

## Status

Final-demo target: **Quasar-compiled Solana programs** for all demo-critical on-chain paths. PR #244 is merged to main as `bbfa0a92`, so the Quasar shared-builder/runtime path is now the mainline baseline.

Legacy Anchor artifacts and devnet registrations may remain as historical/reference evidence only. They are not the active hackathon proof path.

## Proof map for judges

| Surface | Final framing | Evidence | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Quasar programs | Live devnet multi-program deployment powers registry, escrow, reputation, and attestation | Escrow `VYCbMszux9seLK2aXFZMECMBFURvfuJLXsXPmJS5igW`; Registry `Xk7jczJZ1HHJZuE1ZUWDqFmowxYhnom7mWzrNSGf9FU`; Reputation `nb9rLVjoHMibsgfRGgKuPqm6M8GVcH9r6bYNfg7Yiy6`; Attestation `CRGsWWkptdxsH6N6aWAyahLbuMsT58yM624EopEsv1Ex` | Not mainnet-ready; audit architectural blockers remain open |
| Surfpool | Local Quasar confidence gate before devnet | `npm run test:surfpool:quasar-critical` PASS after catching/fixing client commitment hash mismatch | Local validator proof, not production network proof |
| Devnet A→B→C | Live Quasar demo path proves agent-to-agent payment + reputation + attestation | `DEMO_PROGRAM_TARGET=quasar HACKATHON_DEMO_TARGET=quasar DEMO_SETTLEMENT_MODE=public npm run demo --prefix packages/demo-agents` PASS in 6516ms | Public Quasar escrow settlement; MagicBlock PER/TEE not claimed |
| x402 | Agent payment boundary/protocol story | `/economic-demo` and x402/OpenRouter evidence show 402 challenge, controlled receipts, disclosure ledger expectations, and payment-gated agent calls | Controlled/demo receipts unless live verifier is explicitly enabled |
| OpenRouter / 30 specialists | Marketplace of specialist agents for human-triggered workflows | `/economic-demo` uses deployed 30-agent profile metadata and specific use-case triggers | No hidden downstream paid calls on page load |
| Jupiter | Cross-token settlement/boundary lane | Jupiter quote + wallet-specific transaction + devnet signature attempt are evidenced; local Surfpool/mock-Jupiter invoke lane passed at `artifacts/surfpool-jupiter-invoke/20260507-023023/SUMMARY.md`; research note `docs/JUPITER-DEVNET-SWAP-RESEARCH-2026-05-07.md` shows public Jupiter APIs route against mainnet liquidity/account material | Do not claim successful Jupiter devnet execution. Claim only: local successful swap-shaped invoke proof, plus devnet quote/build/sign boundary, unless explicit approved tiny mainnet-beta swap is run |
| MagicBlock | Live Quasar-native permission/delegation proof, not successful settlement claim | `docs/MAGICBLOCK-QUASAR-TEE-REPRO-2026-05-07.md`; `docs/QUASAR-MAGICBLOCK-PER-BDD-PLAYBOOK-2026-05-07.md`; `docs/MAGICBLOCK-PER-TEE-VALIDATION-2026-05-07.md` | createPermission + delegatePermission + escrow delegation succeed live; delegated Quasar program execution fails at MagicBlock TEE instruction start, so final Quasar demo does not claim PER settlement |
| Torque | Retention/leaderboard support layer | `/leaderboard`, `/api/torque/event`, `lib/torque/*`, and Bucket G tests show event/leaderboard plumbing | Supporting layer; not core Quasar on-chain proof |
| ElizaOS / SendAI | Framework adapter distribution | `packages/eliza-plugin-x402`, `packages/sendai-x402`, and planner tool manifest show x402 adapter surfaces | Adapter evidence; not final on-chain proof |
| Web app | Human-triggered demo surface | `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_PROGRAM_TARGET=quasar npm run build` PASS; homepage ecosystem proof map + `/economic-demo` separate Quasar proof from supporting economic evidence | Inspect before recording for visual Anchor ambiguity |

## Recording script spine

1. Open with Quasar target: show the four Quasar program IDs.
2. Show Surfpool local gate: localnet caught a real bug before devnet, then passed.
3. Trigger the frontend economic/demo flow by human action; narrate that it uses 30 specialist profiles and x402-style payment boundaries.
4. Show devnet terminal proof: Quasar A→B→C completes with escrow, settlement, reputation, and attestation.
5. Show ecosystem map: x402/OpenRouter/Jupiter/Surfpool/MagicBlock boundaries. For Jupiter, say: “we can build and sign a Jupiter-routed transaction, but public Jupiter devnet execution is not supported; successful live Jupiter requires mainnet approval.” For MagicBlock, say: “we implemented Quasar-native MagicBlock permission/delegation and proved it live on devnet; the remaining blocker is TEE execution of the delegated Quasar program image, so we do not claim successful PER settlement.”
6. Close honestly: final demo is Quasar-native devnet proof; not mainnet-ready; MagicBlock has live Quasar-native delegation proof but no successful PER settlement claim; successful live Jupiter swap is not claimed unless separately run.

## Required pre-recording gates

```bash
npm run test:surfpool:quasar-critical
npx ts-node --compiler-options '{"module":"CommonJS"}' scripts/check-devnet-agent-pdas.ts
DEMO_PROGRAM_TARGET=quasar HACKATHON_DEMO_TARGET=quasar DEMO_SETTLEMENT_MODE=public npm run demo --prefix packages/demo-agents
npm run check:quasar:submission
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_PROGRAM_TARGET=quasar npm run build
```

## Loop 1 retrospective — after PR #244 merge

- What changed: PR #244 is now merged, so Quasar shared instruction builders and final-demo fail-closed boundaries are on main.
- What we learned: Jupiter devnet is not a viable success path through public Jupiter APIs; the evidence points to mainnet-routed transactions, missing devnet program/account graph, and no network selector.
- Plan adjustment: stop spending time trying to force a Jupiter devnet success. Preserve the honest boundary proof and choose either local/Surfpool simulation or explicit tiny mainnet-beta execution if a successful swap visual is absolutely required.
- Action taken: updated the `/economic-demo` Jupiter card/run timeline so it cannot be misread as a successful devnet Jupiter swap claim. Validation: targeted ESLint, BDD index, and `npm run build` pass.
- Loop 2 action: ran the existing local Surfpool/mock-Jupiter invoke lane. Result: PASS at `artifacts/surfpool-jupiter-invoke/20260507-023023/SUMMARY.md`; trace includes `x402:swap_used:order=ord_surfpool_jupiter_001`.
- Plan adjustment: no new simulation code needed right now. Use the existing Surfpool/mock-Jupiter lane as the successful no-real-funds visual, and keep devnet Jupiter as an honest quote/build/sign rejection boundary.

## Loop 3 retrospective — recording-readiness audit

- What changed: audited the e2e recording path after the Jupiter copy was made more honest.
- What we found: the page copy was corrected, but the Playwright test still expected old “Swap SOL via Jupiter and run” / “Swap execution story” phrasing. That creates drift between automated evidence and final recording language.
- Action taken: updated `e2e/economic-demo.spec.ts` to assert “Show Jupiter boundary and run”, “Intended execution story”, and the explicit public-Jupiter-devnet boundary language.
- Validation: `npx playwright test e2e/economic-demo.spec.ts`, `npm run test:bdd:index`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Plan adjustment: treat e2e assertions as part of the judge-story contract, not just regression tests; future copy changes must update tests in the same loop.
